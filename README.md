ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jamfurell

I'm a software engineer with a background in mental health and administration. As a first generation university graduate, I grew as a goal orientated thinker that used the method of decomposition to successfully reach my goals. I am able to use my experience of interacting with clients of various backgrounds and managing multiple projects to successfully adjust to diverse work environments and meet deadlines with emphasis on attention to details. Seeing how much everyday people's lives are becoming dependent on technology, I gravitate towards software engineering in order to be part of the team that creates opportunities for people to improve the way they build out their life to the fullest.

Frameworks & Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, EJS, React, Express, Django, Python,
Databases: MongoDB, Mongoose, PostgresSQL, Sequelize
Management & Deployment: Git, GitHub, Heroku, Command Line, Slack, Trello
